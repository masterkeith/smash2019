		<p>Wassup my name is Master Lord Keith Jr. I'm from Pittsburgh PA. I was born on August 14, 2004, and I am a first-year scholar here at SMASH Morehouse. I am a really cool, funny, smart, outgoing, sometimes chill, and an independent person. Coming up for me was good. I kinda lived the privileged lifestyle. What I mean by that is I never really needed nor wanted for anything. I appreciate everything that I have, and I acknowledge, feel for, and respect those who may not have it as well as I do. I like interacting with people, laughing, eating tacos, and making people laugh. I'm just an all-around great person to be around, and somebody that anyone can come to when they are down.</p> </div>
		

	 <div id="soo">
	<p>If we are cool or you know me, you know that the one thing I love is my mom. I LOVE my mom more than any other person, thing, or place on this planet. I am extremely grateful for my mom. She's always there when I need her, and I know that if I ever need anything she'll be there. She is the best thing to have ever happened to me, and will forever be that. I love my mom and will always be there for her. When I make it she will be the one for sure person who will never have to worry about anything again. She's the reason I want to be successful. Every morning I wake up all I think is to grind for my mom, Do great for her, and make her proud of me. She is my reason to wake up every morning, she is my reason to do great in school, she is my reason for living, she is my reason for learning, and she is the reason for the road I've chosen to take.
